				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p class="blacktext">Since an early age, I have always enjoyed solving problems and helping people.  As I would mature, I would fall in love with
					technology which would change my life forever.  I found technology rewarding because I was able to help others with something which is unfamiliar 
					to them.  Over time, the problems would grow more complex and the technology more advanced, yet my passion still unsatisfied.  It was not 
					until I began working in the technology industry professionally did I begin to understand the depth, and intricacy of technology.  
					As my knowledge progressed, I found great satisfaction in teaching and training others.  Fortunate for several promotions in my career, 
					I spend much of my time focused on project management, team building, and finding new ways to enhance efficiency, and simplicity in large 
					enterprise environments. </p>
